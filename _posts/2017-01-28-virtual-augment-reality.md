After having spent loads of time working with the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Hololens, and other VR and AR headsets, I'm a raving convert to the idea that Virtual and Augmented Reality will collectively be the next major medium embraced by entertainment and gaming companies, but also by businesses seeking to build serious applications that solve real user needs.

To that end, I've written a few articles exploring some important parts of building VR applications. I'm also scheduled to do a few presentations this year where I'll be helping web developers make the transition into building experiences for Virtual Reality.
