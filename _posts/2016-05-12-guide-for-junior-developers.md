I recently wrote a post on Medium: [The Seven Habits of a Highly Effective Junior Developer][1].

Here are the bullet points:

1. Learn Voraciously

2. Ask Great Questions

3. Clean Code Matters

4. Fail Often — Fail Well

5. Tackle Bite-size Problems

6. Build Things

7. Soft Skills Matter

Give [the whole thing][1] a read if you're into that sort of thing!
