# Dale Knauss

I'm a Virtual Reality and web developer with a burning passion for building great products and growing effective teams.

I'm currently focused on developing Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences for non-gaming/non-entertainment applications at <a href="http://presencepg.com/" target="_blank">Presence</a>.

I believe that developing effective products is more than the languages you use, the frameworks you leverage, or even the code you write. Rather, a good developer is a craftsman, an entrepreneur, a teacher, a lifelong learner, and a scientist -- determined to solve complex problems, produce elegant maintainable solutions, and create maximum business value for their organizations.

For VR/AR projects, I typically use C# with Unity. On the web, my skill set is heavily Javascript focused with an emphasis on modern front-end technologies (React, AngularJS) as well as backend Node frameworks (Express, Meteor). I also have experience working on large Android mobile applications in Java as well as building cross-platform (iOS/Android) applications with React Native.

It goes without saying, though I'll say it anyways because keywords are a thing, that I also have experience with HTML, CSS (SASS & LESS), SQL (PostgreSQL), MongoDB, Git, build tools (NPM, Bower, Gulp, Webpack, Babel, Gradle), testing tools (Jasmine, Selenium, RSpec, JUnit), Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Agile / Lean methodologies, Continuous Integration (Jenkins), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and more Javascript libraries than I care to admit (Redux, JQuery, Backbone, Underscore, RequireJS, Knockout, D3.js, etc.).

I love traveling the world, meditation, tennis, ping pong, running, and reading everything I can get my hands on.
