# Dale Knauss

I'm a software developer with a burning passion for building great products and growing effective teams.

I believe that developing effective products is more than the languages you use, the frameworks you leverage, or even the code you write. Rather, a good developer is a craftsman, an entrepreneur, a teacher, a lifelong learner, and a scientist -- determined to solve complex problems, produce elegant maintainable solutions, and create maximum business value for their organizations.

My skill set is heavily Javascript focused with an emphasis on modern front-end technologies (React, AngularJS, React Native) as well as backend Node frameworks (Express, Meteor). I also have experience working on large Android mobile applications in Java and building backends in Ruby on Rails.

It goes without saying, though I'll say it anyways because keywords are a thing, that I also have experience with HTML, CSS (SASS and LESS), SQL (PostgreSQL), MongoDB, Git, build tools (NPM, Bower, Gulp, Webpack, Babel, Gradle), testing tools (Jasmine, Selenium, RSpec, JUnit), Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Agile / Lean methodologies, Continuous Integration (Jenkins), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and more Javascript libraries than I care to admit (Redux, JQuery, Backbone, Underscore, RequireJS, Knockout, D3.js, etc.).

I'm also a marketing professional with eight years of experience helping startups and small businesses grow with repeatable, proven strategies. I'm experienced with Paid Search Advertising (PPC), Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), Copywriting, Email Marketing, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and leveraging Analytics to build powerful Sales Funnels.

I also love traveling the world, meditation, tennis, ping pong, running, spending time with my beautiful wife, and reading everything I can get my hands on.
